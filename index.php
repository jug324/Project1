<div class="questions">
<h2>In 2+ sentences, describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>I'm a Vermont raised, Northeastern graduate who currently lives out in the suburbs of Boston in Arlington. I currently work for Harvard in the Alumni Records Office, where I specialize in processing foreign data. Although I was an avid musician and composer throughout school, I now tend to spend the majority of my free time writing a series of novels.</p>

<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>I took an interest in computer science and technology after I interned at a local start-up (before coming to Harvard). Considering the wonderful resources Harvard offers its employees, in this case through the Extension School, I decided to pursue an education revolving web technologies. I've spent the last few semesters working towards the Web Technologies professional certificate and decided to venture further into web applications.</p>
<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>The majority of previous education and experience has been focused on creating web pages/sites (using html, xml, css, etc.). This semester, I am also taking a class focused on java.</p>
<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>My main work computer is a Mac Mini running running OX X version 10.6.8.</p>
